They say the Sun)
(And it shines for all)
(But in some people world)
(It never shine at all)

These roads of flames are catchin' on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Showed you I love you, you called me a liar
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone
I've been feelin' for your love so long
We can praise Jah in the moonlight
Baby, if you with me, better do right
And I've been gone too long
And I'm hopin' that you sing my songs (sing my songs)
I've been on this road for way too long
I've been hoping that we all get along

These roads of flames are catchin' on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Showed you I love you, you called me a liar

Give Jah the thanks and praises
I've been on my own all along
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
And if I'm tellin' you the feeling is wrong
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long

And when you're feelin' alone
You can call my phone
Is there a better way to go?
Teach them something before they lose their soul
Oh, no, no, no, freedom is the road
Oh, no, no, no, comin' in from the cold
Tell them not to sell, it is worth more than gold
And guiltiness will catch them in the end
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Now you're callin', gonna fuck with the optic, with the vision
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Tryin' to control your soul and take control, oh, no, no, no
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
No, we don't play that game right here to win power
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)
Give Jah all the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)
Yes, give Him the thanks and praises
Give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises)
Give Jah the thanks and praises
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises) oh, oh
Give Jah the thanks and praises

Oh, woah, give Jah the thanks, the thanks
The thanks (praises), the thanks (praises)
The thanks (praises), the thanks (praises)
Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks and praises (give Jah)
(Thanks and) give Jah the thanks and praises (praises)
(Give Jah thanks and praises, praises)
(Give Jah thanks and praises, praises)

(Give every bit to Him)
(Praises)
(Give every bit to Him)
(Praises)
