Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say: Oh, sing one you know

But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say: Oh
I say: Oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do

I know I was wrong
I won't let you down
(Oh, yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will)

I say: Oh
I cry: Oh

Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks

Sing it out
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
